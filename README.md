# Exchange Rate Calculator

This is a small JavaScript application that calculates the exchange rate between different currencies.

## Usage

To use the application, call the `convertCurrency` function with the following parameters:

- `from`: The currency code you are converting from (e.g., "AED").
- `to`: The currency code you are converting to (e.g., "LKR").
- `amount`: The amount of money you want to convert (e.g., 15000).

Example:

```javascript
convertCurrency("AED", "LKR", 15000);
